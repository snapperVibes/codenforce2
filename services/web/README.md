## Development Details
[Tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo) (the author of FastApi), has Dockerfiles and Cookiecutters set up for FastApi projects.
Unfortunately for me, they included too many tools that I was not yet familiar with.
I decided to learn the tools by setting this project up on my own and use the convince scripts in the future.
